Homework 3  hangman game

by Rich Budek 02/02/2018

Summary:
This is the more advanced assignment.  It uses graphics to make the game more realistic.

Technolgies used:
1. HTML for general page layout.  Handcoded to match porfolio pages
2. Responsive design
3. BootStrap for nice buttons and menu
4. Javascript for program functions
5. Using Javascript to manipulate images on the screen to make simple animations
6. Using Javascript to change text colors for red and green letters
7. Modal windows to give clean pop ups

Internal design
1. Javascript manupulates the HTML elements directly using Document.QuerySelect.()
2. Most of code re-written as object and methods to make it clearer and easier to handle
3. Words are stored in an array of arrays ... called dictionaries and separated by subject
4. All elements are linked using getElementID

Left to do:
1. Loading the next word works and method does, just need to add a button to do it.
2. Game settings to be toggles and buttons
3. High score recording

Some bugs:
1. If the word has more than one of the same letter, in display, it put booth letters in the letters used space.
